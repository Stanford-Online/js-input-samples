# JS Input Examples #

This repository originally comes from Stanford University, and is now maintained by Harvard. It holds problem types for edX, for use as [Custom JavaScript Display and Grading](https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/exercises_tools/custom_javascript.html) problems. 

## Projects ##
- "[Accessible Matching](https://github.com/HarvardX/js-input-samples/tree/master/matching_accessible)": A standard matching-type problem as seen in a myriad of classroom quizzes. Designed to be usable on screen readers as well as by sighted users.
- "[Card Sorting](https://github.com/HarvardX/js-input-samples/tree/master/cardsorting)": A card-sorting exercise. Used to in cognitive science to measure expertise in a particular field.
- "[Celluar Automata](https://github.com/HarvardX/js-input-samples/tree/master/automata)": Full-featured JS Input project demonstrating a cellular automata problem.
- "[Drop File](https://github.com/HarvardX/js-input-samples/tree/master/dropfile)": A bare-bones problem that uses Javascript to check a file and see whether it's an image or text. Constructed as an example of how someone might create a file-processing problem.
- "[Journaling](https://github.com/HarvardX/js-input-samples/tree/master/journaling)" - Rich text editor that saves to the Learner Backpack (below) and gives credit for entering text. Uses [HX-JS](https://github.com/Colin-Fredericks/hx-js).
- "[Learner Backpack](https://github.com/HarvardX/js-input-samples/tree/master/learner_backpack)": Creates storage for student-associated data in edX. Meant to be used with [HX-JS](https://github.com/Colin-Fredericks/hx-js), but adaptable for other purposes.
- "[Mirror](https://github.com/HarvardX/js-input-samples/tree/master/mirror)": Simple 'Hello World' project that works well as a barebones starter.
- "[Mufi Text Editor](https://github.com/HarvardX/js-input-samples/tree/master/mufi_text_editor)": Simple, lightweight rich text editor. Grades on participation.
- "[Piano](https://github.com/HarvardX/js-input-samples/tree/master/piano)": More complicated project that demonstrates more advanced use of JS Input
- "[Qualtrics Grader](https://github.com/HarvardX/js-input-samples/tree/master/qualtrics_grader)": Allows grading of Qualtrics surveys based on percent completion.
- "[Range Guesser](https://github.com/HarvardX/js-input-samples/tree/master/range_guesser)": Allows students to guess at a number (or time) by setting a range. Closer guess = more credit.
- "[Text Logging Problem](https://github.com/HarvardX/js-input-samples/tree/master/text_logger)": Gives students credit for entering free-response text, and logs it.
- "[Variable Passing](https://github.com/HarvardX/js-input-samples/tree/master/variablepassing)": How to get numbers or text generated by the problem's Python code into your internal Javascript. Also, how to log your results in the official edX logs.
- "[Video Watch Credit](https://github.com/HarvardX/js-input-samples/tree/master/videowatch)": Gives students credit for watching a video, or for just having it play while they go make a sandwich.

## Deprecated Projects ##
- "[Matching](https://github.com/HarvardX/js-input-samples/tree/master/deprecated/matching)": A standard matching-type problem as seen in a myriad of classroom quizzes. Replaced by the [Accessible Matching](https://github.com/HarvardX/js-input-samples/tree/master/matching_accessible) problem.
- "[Adaptive MC](https://github.com/HarvardX/js-input-samples/tree/master/adaptive_mc)": Creates a set of resources where the path depends on a student's answers to MC questions. Still under construction.
